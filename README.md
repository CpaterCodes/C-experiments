# Shenanigans with the C programming language

## Rationale

For a time I have been meaning to explore use of the C programming
language. 
The language allows for some of the most performant code of all languages,
rendering it foundational to a number of performance-critical systems.

Moreover, learning the language also provides an interesting opportunity to
implement a number of basic data structures which are either otherwise 
missing from C or for which alternative, bespoke implementations have been 
produced by C users.

Learning C can also provide broader insights into the workings of software
and computer systems: while I would personally consider it a misguided
choice for an introduction to application development or programming more 
broadly, it is difficult to argue with its utility for the exploration of
lower-level computer science concerns such as memory management, computer 
architecture, networking and systems programming.

## Tasks

1. Implement stacks, queues and perhaps other dynamic data structures...
