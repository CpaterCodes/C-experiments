# An Exploration of the C programming language

## Rationale

For a time I have wanted to explore use of the C programming
language for a number of reasons.

Firstly, with the rapid evolution of languages/frameworks in software I
am intrigued not just by general principles such as the deeper workings of
software, but also by long-lived technologies such as C which are likely to
continue to be relevant even with the rise of novel languages. 

Secondly, owing to my previous experience with largely higher-level,
general purpose languages with rich features I have been meaning to explore
a lower-level language such as C. Moreover, I also welcome the challenges 
which arise where built-in dynamic data structures, for example, 
are not a given. 
These once again provide the chance to understand concepts
such as file I/O, networking and memory management etc. in depth.

Thirdly, the language itself also still boasts a crucial use-case in the 
production of simple systems where performance is critical - even where 

## Tasks

1. Implement a Stack:
```
- Should hold a series of items [completed]
- Should have a set capacity [completed]
- Should accept items pushed and store them [completed]
- Should yield items popped and relinquish them [completed]
- Should be extendable [pending]
- Should be safely contractable [pending]
- Should make contents viewable [pending]
```
